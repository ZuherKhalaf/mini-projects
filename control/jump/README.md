# Jump Statements in Java

This directory contains basic examples of jump control statements in Java:

- **break**: Exits a loop or switch statement prematurely.
- **continue**: Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds with the next one.
- **return**: Exits from the current method and optionally returns a value.

Each file demonstrates the behavior of these statements in simple scenarios.
