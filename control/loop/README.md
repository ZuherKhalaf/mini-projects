# Loop Control Mechanisms

This folder contains simple Java implementations of all basic loop control mechanisms:

- **For Loop**: Classic counted loop.
- **Enhanced For Loop (For-Each)**: Iteration over arrays or collections.
- **While Loop**: Condition-controlled loop, checks before execution.
- **Do-While Loop**: Condition-controlled loop, checks after execution (executes at least once).

Each loop type is implemented in its own Java file to demonstrate its usage clearly.
