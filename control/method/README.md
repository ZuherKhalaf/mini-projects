# Method Control Mechanisms

This folder demonstrates two fundamental method-based control mechanisms in Java:

## SimpleMethod.java
- Shows a basic method call.
- `greet(String name)` is a simple method that prints a greeting message.
- Demonstrates how methods can encapsulate reusable logic and be invoked from `main`.

## RecursiveMethod.java
- Demonstrates recursion, where a method calls itself.
- Implements a recursive factorial function.
- Highlights the power of recursion for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

Both examples illustrate how methods control the flow of execution in a program, enabling modular and maintainable code.
