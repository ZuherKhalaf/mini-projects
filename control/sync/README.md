# Synchronization Examples in Java

This folder contains basic examples for synchronization mechanisms used in Java for multithreaded programming.

## Files Overview

- **SynchronizedBlockExample.java**  
  Demonstrates how to use `synchronized` blocks to ensure mutual exclusion.

- **SynchronizedMethodExample.java**  
  Shows synchronization using entire methods.

- **WaitNotifyExample.java**  
  Example of inter-thread communication using `wait()` and `notify()`.

## Purpose

Synchronization is crucial in multithreaded applications to avoid race conditions and ensure consistent data access.

Java provides:

- `synchronized` methods or blocks to protect critical sections.
- `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` to coordinate between threads.
