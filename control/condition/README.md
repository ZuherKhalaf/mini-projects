# Conditional Control Mechanisms

This directory contains basic examples of conditional statements in Java:

- **if**: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
- **if-else**: Executes one of two blocks based on a condition.
- **if-else if-else**: Allows multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.
- **switch**: Selects a code block to execute based on the value of a variable.

Each file demonstrates the syntax and use case of its respective control mechanism.
